    Digital download sent via PM<br/>Includes games, standard galactic alphabet, and Dosbox 0.6.3<br/><br/>Seven official Commander Keen games were released for the PC under MS-DOS. They are divided into mini-series, and are considered &quot;episodes&quot; of the full series. Under the Apogee &#118;ersion of the shareware model (the &quot;Apogee Model&quot;), the first episode of a series was usually available as shareware. The eighth game in the series is available exclusively for the Game Boy Color.<br/>Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons[edit]<br/>1. &quot;Marooned on Mars&quot; (first released as shareware on December 14, 1990)<br/>While Commander Keen is exploring Mars, the Vorticon steal four vital components of his ship and hide them in Martian cities, each guarded by a Vorticon soldier. In this episode, Keen acquires his trademark pogo stick and meets a variety of Martian aliens and robots.<br/>2. &quot;The Earth Explodes&quot;<br/>Keen returns to Earth only to find the Vorticon mothership hovering above with its deadly X-14 Tantalus Ray cannons locked on to eight of Earth&#39;s greatest landmarks: Big Ben (London), the Sphinx (Cairo), the Sydney Opera House (Sydney), the Statue of Liberty (New York), the Eiffel Tower (Paris), the Colosseum (Rome), St Basil&#39;s Cathedral (Moscow), and the White House (Washington D.C.). Keen has to find and deactivate each of the cannons to save Earth. Unlike the first game which had a happy and friendly atmosphere, almost everything in this game is hostile towards Keen, from the floating machine gun robots to the electrified floors. The engine has more features than the first episode, such as light switches and moving platforms.<br/>3. &quot;Keen Must Die!&quot;<br/>Keen travels to the Vorticon homeworld in search of the mysterious Grand Intellect that has directed the Vorticons toward Earth. The game features the cities, parks, and suburbs of the Vorticons, and their women, children, pets, and mechanical toys make up the enemies. The Vorticon alphabet is also decoded in a school house, allowing for the player to travel to the other in-game locations and read the Vorticon signs.<br/>Commander Keen: Keen Dreams[edit]<br/>Main article: Commander Keen: Keen Dreams<br/>3.5. &quot;Keen Dreams&quot; aka &quot;The Lost Episode&quot; (published as shareware by Softdisk)<br/>After refusing to eat his vegetables, Billy is sent to bed by his parents. He falls asleep, only to awaken in a strange vegetable kingdom led by the evil potato king Boobus Tuber, who has imprisoned other sleeping children there. In the dream world, Keen does not have his trademark raygun and pogo stick, but has to defend himself with &quot;Flower Power&quot; seeds that temporarily turn enemies into flowers.<br/>On June 10, 2013, &quot;Keen Dreams&quot; was published for Android enabled devices by Super Fighter Team, under license from Flat Rock Software.[3]<br/>Commander Keen in Goodbye, Galaxy![edit]<br/>4. &quot;Secret of the &#79;racle&quot; (first released as shareware on December 15, 1991)<br/>Keen&#39;s newly finished homemade faster-than-light radio picks up a plot by the Shikadi to destroy the galaxy. He rushes to the planet Gnosticus IV to consult the Keepers of the &#79;racle, but discovers that they have been taken captive. Thus, the gameplay centers on Keen finding and rescuing the eight elders. This episode features huge levels and a wide variety of enemies and modified game mechanics.<br/>5. &quot;The Armageddon Machine&quot;<br/>After getting information from the &#79;racle, Keen lands on a massive Shikadi space station, the Omegamatic, nicknamed the Armageddon Machine, and seeks out the mysterious Gannalech. The gameplay centers on Keen advancing through the Omegamatic to deactivate it.<br/>Commander Keen in Aliens Ate My Baby Sitter![edit]<br/>6. &quot;Aliens Ate My Baby Sitter!&quot; (published commercially only by FormGen, Apogee resold it as a retailer; now discontinued)<br/>When Keen&#39;s babysitter Molly is abducted by the Bloogs, Keen must come to her rescue by fighting his way through the inhabitants of the planet Fribbulus Xax. This is the last episode of the original Keen series. A demo &#118;ersion of this game was also released.<br/>Game Boy Color[edit]<br/>Main article: Commander Keen (2001 video game)<br/>The 2001 release for the Game Boy Color, titled simply Commander Keen, was the final release in the series. Although it was developed by David A. Palmer Productions, id had heavy involvement in the direction of the game, and Adrian Carmack was directly involved in creating art assets.[4]<br/>Other releases and cancelled games[edit]<br/>On August 3, 2007, episodes 1-5 (excluding &quot;Keen Dreams&quot; and &quot;Aliens Ate My Baby Sitter!&quot;) were rereleased on Steam as part of the id Software game addition to Steam. The package was priced at USD$4.95 on release. In this release, the DOSBox emulator is used to run the games on Microsoft &#87;indows.<br/>A Commander Keen game for the Nintendo Entertainment System was planned. It was supposed to be released by a major American Nintendo publishing company.[5]<br/>An additional trilogy, tentatively titled The Universe is Toast!, was planned for Christmas 1992, but it was never produced, as id moved on to Wolfenstein 3D and then Doom. Tom Hall claims that he intends to make a new game if he ever reclaims the intellectual property rights to Commander Keen.[6]<br/>Monkeystone Games planned to release Keen Chronicles through Softek International in April 2002. It would have consisted of all Keen games packaged together for Microsoft &#87;indows and Pocket PC, but it never got out of the planning stages, and was never even officially announced. The logo that would have been used was the only product of the project, and it can be seen here.[7]
