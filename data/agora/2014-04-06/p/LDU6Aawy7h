    1 oz (28 grams) Purple TrainWreck Grade A+ outdoor<br/><br/>**FE required**<br/><br/>Trainwreck is a sativa-dominant cannabis strain that hits you as hard as a freight train that you don&#39;t see coming. Burns quick and produces thick smoke that will almost certainly get you coughing. People swear by Trainwreck for its pain relief and other medicinal qualities.<br/><br/>We only ship to the USA.<br/><br/>***Please read our full profile *before* asking questions. You may find the answer here. ***<br/><br/>Forum feedback:http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.&#112;hp?topic=17285.0<br/><br/>1. New info(look here for current updates)<br/>2. Contest, win some free weed!<br/>3. Who we are and what we do<br/>4. Bulk listings, QP and above.<br/>5. Shipping(a must read)<br/>6. Product<br/>7. Misc, and stuff<br/><br/>1. New info<br/>**********************************************************************<br/>Jan 16th<br/>We are now allowing escrow purchases(no FE), for previous customers(2 purchases or more) for orders 1oz or less.<br/><br/>If you are a new customer or are ordering more than 1oz, than you must FE.<br/><br/>Prime customers; no need to FE for any amount.<br/><br/>Jan 15th<br/>We are currently taking orders with FE.<br/><br/>Jan 13th<br/>Quick update: All orders have been &#112;rocessed and messages replied to (where still relevant). So everyone and everything should be up to date and on track. Thanks for your patience and understanding. Site usability, speed and outages make it very difficult to actually track and &#112;rocess orders and, as mentioned, we are working to get around these to reduce impact on our customers. Please check back tomorrow for updates.<br/><br/>thanks!<br/><br/>WGs<br/><br/>As you know, there have been a number of significant delays over the past week or so, including scheduled and un-scheduled downtime, all of which have made it difficult, if not impossible to &#112;rocess orders and reply to messages in a timely manner.<br/><br/>There are also inherent issues within the SR2.0 interface that make it hard to track, message, reply to and generally administer accounts. We have been trying very hard to navigate these issues while continuing to provide a quality and prompt service but we hope that you appreciate the efforts we are making to continue to get good quality product to our customers.<br/><br/>Please note the following:<br/><br/>- All orders will be &#112;rocessed as they arrived and then marked as &#39;shipped&#39;. You will then be informed individually that you are able to FE the &#116;ransaction.<br/>- Once FE-ed, the shipment will be &#112;rocessed and sent<br/>- Your shipment will arrive within the timeline listed on our profile, depending on which shipping option you selected<br/>- Tracking details will not be be provided unless there is an issue. If you find a real issue, please message us and we will look into it for you Please do not message us until after you expect your package to arrive as it causes further delays for all.<br/>- The SR2.0 messaging system is not email. There are no capabilities to track message strings or to simply message a buyer directly. All messages are associated with an order. Therefore, ONLY message when there is a real issue, get any general questions answered in the forum.<br/>-There are a lot of messages in the queue. Do NOT panic if your message remains unanswered. Your message will be answered/&#112;rocessed in order received IF it relates to your order.<br/><br/>We are working on on getting around these shortcomings of the system ASAP, so please check back HERE later today or tomorrow for updates on the order &#112;rocess.<br/><br/>For orders sent over the weekend and late last week, please wait until Wednesday for shipment to arrive. ALL orders that were FE-ed have been sent.<br/><br/>We look forward to continuing working with you and providing superior services to our repeat and prime customers.<br/><br/>Congrats to our first blacklisted: &quot;666hailsatan666&quot; you may no longer order from us.<br/><br/>thanks<br/><br/>-WGs<br/><br/>Jan 9th<br/><br/>Update to all customers with open orders. Reminders are being sent today to all those with open orders to ensure that the FE is completed and doesn&#39;t delay shipment (notice: if you ordered before this policy change, your order is probably already in transit).<br/><br/>We are working as fast as we can but the site is running very slowly so ALL orders are being prioritized above message replies. Do not panic if you do not receive a timely reply to your message. This does not mean that there are any issues with your order. You will be contacted if there are any clarifications required to complete your order.<br/><br/>ALL new orders, will be marked as shipped and you will be notified. FE at this point so that shipment can be made without delay. The less time we spend on communicating back and forth, the more time we have to actually &#112;rocess the shipments.<br/><br/>Looks like withdraws have a manual &#112;rocess involved on the SR2.0 side. We are still requiring you to FE for your package to ship. Withdraws are taking about 12-18 hours and we don&#39;t ship until the money is in our pocket, so take that into account for delivery time.<br/>Jan 8th<br/>Still seeing slow withdraws, but we are shipping orders. Weather is causing delays in some areas.<br/>Jan 7th<br/>When SR2.0 release our funds, orders who have FEed will ship.<br/>Jan 6th<br/>Until SR2.0 fixes the timelyness of their withdraw and things have settled down, we are going to require FE on all orders. All open orders must FE. If you don&#39;t feel comfortable FEing, then msg us, and we&#39;ll cancel the order.<br/>Jan 6th<br/>Minor set back in shipping, samples are running a day behind, everything else is on-time.<br/>Jan 4th<br/>Next week Jan 6th-7th, we will be getting more Grade A+ outdoor, Purple Trainwreak, and BlueDream. It will sell for $185 a oz. There will be no bulk for this listing.<br/>Jan 1st<br/>We are now servicing customers on SR2.0. FE not required.<br/>**********************************************************************<br/><br/>2. Contest<br/>**********************************************************************<br/>***** No contest at this time.<br/>**********************************************************************<br/><br/>3. Who we are and what we do<br/>**********************************************************************<br/>Hello, we are the WeedGirls. Bringing you the finest weed around! You will not find better prices nor bigger mounds of greens.<br/>We specialize in high grade indoor hydro, but also offer some other grades.<br/><br/>Our motto; Q.P.S.<br/><br/>Q=Quality, only the best.<br/>P=Price,the lowest price.<br/>S=Service, extreme!!.. customer service<br/><br/>****Must Read*****<br/>**Because we have suffer the shutdown of SR, and the rip-off of Sheep, and Tormarket, almost half of what we lost on each market was due to buyers not finalizing in a timely manner. We will now require everyone to FE and we will ship your order as quickly as possible. Please Note: FE will not fast track your order. We need to mark the order as &#39;shipped&#39; so that you can FE. Your order will subsequently be &#112;rocessed and shipped. We are working hard to reduce the adminstration efforts so that your shipments go out as soon as possible. Please work with us on this.**<br/><br/>Also, we will not be bullied, bribed or blackmailed over product feedback. Leave what you think of the product and service. We would rather suffer a bad review than to give into blackmail for a good one.<br/>**********************************************************************<br/><br/>4. Bulk listings, QP and above.<br/>**********************************************************************<br/>All bulk is in our listings.<br/>**********************************************************************<br/><br/>5.

Product<br/><br/>Most of our product is high grade indoor hydro.<br/>Grading system; We use a grading system just like you remember from school.<br/>A+<br/>A<br/>A-<br/>B+<br/>B<br/>B-<br/>C+<br/>C-<br/>D+<br/>We don&#39;t sell below D+<br/>Each product will be labeled indoor or outdoor and have a letter grade. We pride ourselves on marking the product with a proper letter grade and will not over mark something. If you ever see a A++, buy it. It will be the best weed you have ever smoked.<br/><br/>Curing:<br/>Most of our outdoor is cured over a 1-2 week period for maximum potential. And is not too dry or wet. Most of our indoor is &quot;quick cured&quot;, This means a quick 3-4 days drying period and a 1-2 day settle. Our indoor is usually on the dryer side of perfect, except for our XJ-13. This gives you the customer more bang for your buck. Some of our indoor will go through a medium drying, 3-6 days, with a UV light. This makes the plant output a little more resin. These will be labled as &quot;UV cured&quot;.<br/><br/>7. Misc, and stuff<br/>**********************************************************************<br/>When Service is down: coming soon (WeedWorld), wgs@countermail.com<br/><br/>Prime Accounts:<br/>Optional features:<br/><br/>Free priority shipping.<br/>$20 express shipping.<br/>Email tracking notifications.<br/>Pre-order upcoming strains.<br/>Free samples of new strains and/or batches.<br/><br/>It&#39;s good to be &quot;prime&quot; :)<br/><br/>How do you get a &quot;Prime&quot; account?
