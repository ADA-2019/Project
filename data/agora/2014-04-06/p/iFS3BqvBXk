    www.gettheredpill.com<br/><br/>Do You Find Meeting Women Difficult, Stressful Or Confusing?...<br/><br/>I&#39;ll Reveal:<br/><br/>* How today&#39;s society is holding you back from getting the women you deserve... And how you can show a woman you&#39;re an &quot;In The Know&quot; guy she can go home with, immediately, boyfriend or not. (Think I&#39;m joking? Here&#39;s a scary stat: I&#39;ve slept with hundreds of women... Minutes before they left to hang out at their boyfriend&#39;s place)<br/><br/>* How I know President Obama is a member of this secret society... And -- whether or not you agree with his policies -- I reveal the exact, specific way to take his charisma and master it for yourself (Here&#39;s a hint: He won simply because he could captivate people&#39;s attention... And when you know these skills, some &quot;random guy&quot; doesn&#39;t stand a chance)<br/><br/>* Why women don&#39;t want &quot;players&quot;... Most guys think you need to be &#39;smooth&#39; to get into her panties... But she&#39;s actually looking for a specific set of characteristics only &quot;In The Know&quot; guys have (This is the fool-proof method she uses to weed out the &#39;fakers&#39;... And she will do anything you ask, if you past the &quot;test&quot;)<br/><br/>* Why the &quot;seduction commmunity&quot; is a sham... Because they spread around the same limiting beliefs about women, packaged under different names. I&#39;ll show you how to ditch those harmful habits, while mastering new, effective ways of meeting women in minutes<br/><br/>* How to get a girl back to your place in as little as 15 minutes... I will show you the tips, tricks and tactics you need PLUS I&#39;ll let you in on a little secret, which reveals why sleeping with a woman as soon as you meet her, is better for a long-term relationship<br/><br/>* The one trick a wise, old Jazz musician told me, which changed the way men pick-up women, forever... My jazz teacher told me one sentence which has given me untold success with women... And has helped men around the globe, just like you, finally meet the women they deserve (I&#39;ll reveal it inside, and explain why it&#39;s so powerful)<br/><br/>* Your past failures with women are holding you back from meeting girls, today... Because you subconciously are used to rejection, it&#39;s tougher for you to meet women today. I&#39;ll tell you how to erase those past failures, and get started with a clean slate immediately (Out of EVERYTHING... This one simple tweak will give you overnight, dramatic transformation in your ability to meet women)<br/><br/>* Want to sleep with 10 women? How about 100? BULLSHIT! You may believe you want to sleep with a bunch of women... But I&#39;ll reveal why dating any more than 3 women at a time becomes harder than a full-time job... And how to land the handful of quality women who take the place of five or six &quot;lookers&quot; with no substance<br/><br/>* My 5 Rules Of Power which guarantee you have the &quot;upper hand&quot; in any relationship. They may seem simple, but I will show you specific examples of how to use them, in order to make a first-date almost sure-fire sex (As of writing this, I&#39;ve had three new girls over - straight to my place - this week... And they&#39;ve all been first dates)<br/><br/>* How to use her &quot;guy friends&quot; to keep her happy... And even do work for YOU... You can use her guy &quot;friends&quot; -- who have no shot at getting into her panties -- To keep her happy, content and even more sexually excited for you... As well as get your day-to-day chores handled, for free (This may seem a little dirty now... But wait until your laundry, cleaning, cooking and groceries are done for you... By the guys you were scared to leave your girlfriend around)<br/><br/>...And I don&#39;t mean that she was a &quot;freak&quot; or &quot;sex-crazed&quot; at all. I&#39;m talking about a secret &#39;sisterhood&#39; of unwritten rules women have, that lets her cheat on every guy she&#39;s ever been with... While her friends, sister, and even MOTHER will cover for her.<br/><br/>She revealed:<br/><br/>* How being &quot;In The Know&quot; about a handful of her &quot;girl rules&quot; gives her permission to cheat on her boyfriend with you (Girls have a secret, &#39;sisterhood&#39; code of conduct which would shock most men... And cheating on your &quot;in the dark&quot; boyfriend is a huge part of it)<br/><br/>* The one sexual technique women crave from their man, but you can&#39;t find in Maxim, Cosmo or any &#39;naughty&#39; magazine... And end up cheating on him with an &quot;In The Know&quot; guy to get (And - surprisingly - It&#39;s not a mind-blowing orgasm or other &quot;freak of nature&quot;... It&#39;s one, simple way to compliment a girl which will drive her wild)<br/><br/>* Why even the good-girl gal next door will hop into bed with the first &quot;In The Know&quot; guy who comes her way... And how to build an iron fence around her love for you (These are the black-bag secrets I use to keep my girlfriends loyal... Even while I&#39;m busy playing the field)<br/><br/>* One sure-fire secret line women use to tell you she&#39;s cheating on you.... Yet goes &quot;under the radar&quot; of all but the most perceptive players (She thinks she&#39;s being direct and honest... So when she cheats on you the next day, she&#39;ll tell herself you &quot;saw it coming&quot;)<br/><br/>* How to snatch a girl off her &quot;goodie two-shoes&quot; or Johnny Badass boyfriend... Using a simple trick which makes her beg to keep your relationship a secret (My Trainer Heartwork used these tips to date a famous pop-singer, without it ever hitting the tabloids or gossip rags)<br/><br/>...Women Are MORE Willing To Go Home With You<br/>In Under 2-4 Hours, If You Met Her During The Day!<br/><br/>I know, it goes against everything your friends, father and MTV ever told you about women... And that&#39;s why it&#39;s still so sneaky-effective.<br/><br/>The cold-hard truth is: Millions of women are being taken home by guys who know what they&#39;re doing...<br/><br/>... Whether they were &quot;born with it&quot;, or discovered my techniques...<br/><br/>... Each and everyday, yet most &quot;regular men&quot; like you and me, wouldn&#39;t have a clue.<br/><br/>But the whole &#39;balance of power&#39; is about to shift back in your favor, when you listen to the tell-it-like-it-is secrets on this CD.<br/><br/>You&#39;ll Discover:<br/><br/>* The best (and best-kept-secret) places for meeting attractive, sexual and intelligent women, during the day-time (These &#39;hot-spots&#39; are packed with gorgeous women looking for men... And only two or three guys, who clean up with phone numbers and sexual attention)<br/><br/>* What women will judge you on... In the first 3-seconds of your conversation... And how one simple switch in your eye-contact will leave a lasting impression she&#39;ll brag to her friends about (Maybe you think your clothes, your breath or your posture is killing your first-impression... But it&#39;s actually something much easier to fix - And sneakier to find)<br/><br/>* 99% of the time, she wants to meet a man in a &quot;romance novel fantasy&quot;... And this includes meeting Prince Charming one-minute, sleeping with him the next! Use this female-fantasy to your advantage with these Insider&#39;s secrets (This is the stuff I&#39;ve used to take girls home within 15 minutes of meeting her)<br/><br/>* Three sneaky reasons picking up women during the day forces her to see you as the most attractive man she&#39;s ever dated... Even if you don&#39;t have deep pockets of Brad Pitt good-looks (She&#39;ll brag to her friends about how she met you... Making them wonder and want a &quot;piece&quot;)<br/><br/>* The only sure-fire &quot;line&quot; to use on a woman... That&#39;s so simple, you can make it up on the spot, yet effective no matter HOW hot she is, or busy she seems (I hate giving you &quot;lines&quot; to use... But this simple formula gives you the quick-thinking of a stand-up comic, each and every time)<br/><br/>* Plus... A whole lot more
