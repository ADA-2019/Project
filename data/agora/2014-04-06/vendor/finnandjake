            AKA: MyConnect on other sites.<br/><br/>Our stealth cannot be beat. The number one thing that we can guarantee is that you won&#39;t find better stealth. Our shit don&#39;t stink til you open it. Guaranteed!<br/><br/>WERE ARE PREPARED TO BE COMPLETELY TRANSPARENT WITH YOU.<br/><br/>I&#39;ve been a Middle-Man on the streets for almost 20 years. My #1 rule has always been &quot;never tell anyone what you actually pay for your product. It&#39;s OK to tell you &quot;your&quot; price but I&#39;ll never tell you &quot;my&quot; price&quot;. The dark web is a different game. You can&#39;t undercut me because you don&#39;t know me, and you don&#39;t know my supplier. With that being said, I&#39;m ready to break my #1 rule. I&#39;m ready to tell you what I pay...<br/><br/>We pay $1600 per LB. Easy math... we pay $100 per OZ. We sell our OZ&#39;s for $160, we make $60 profit. If we sell 4 OZ&#39;s in a day, that&#39;s $240. It is worth it for us to sell at these prices. $1680 per week is considered good money where I&#39;m from.<br/><br/>We are here to make $$ and we believe in the cause.<br/><br/>WE WERE ONCE BUYERS, WE KNOW WHY YOU MAY HAVE YOUR DOUBTS.<br/><br/>People have been questioning our prices because they are too low. They think that we are trying to scam them.<br/><br/>We live in Northern California, it&#39;s pretty much legal in our area. Everyone here grows. Hydroponic supply stores are as common as liquor stores.<br/><br/>Put your faith in us and we won&#39;t let you down.<br/><br/>We take every step of the &#112;rocess seriously. We operate with an almost autistic attention to detail. We are former members of the SR1 (different name). We used our current name while operating on Sheep and TMP. We have never received less than a 5/5 rating for any order. If you think that there is a better vendor out there, feel free to tell us why. We want to know what we could be doing better.<br/><br/>The following link is a Mirror to our sheep homepage. You can view our feedback here.<br/><br/>http://xoqyrrgahnoenamg.onion/sm/SM_MIRROR/sheep5u64fi457aw.onion/account/profile/801877548767699405ab01a94909f058.html<br/><br/>░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░<br/><br/>►We can confidently claim that our stealth is the best. We&#39;ve even had some vendors asking for our advice with their shipping methods. You are guaranteed a secure package from us.<br/><br/>►We notice that quite a few vendors have some level of negative feedback. Frankly because they are not professional and they are jumping into this business without a goal. We had a very successful operation on SR and EVERY package made it to it&#39;s destination with a stellar 5/5 rating across the board. We had almost no issues. How? We communicate and handle every situation professionally. We avoid receiving negative feedback by stopping it before it happens.<br/><br/>►We are here to make money by providing honestly described products, and building business relationships. To make money you need a plan and you need to stick to it. The two most important parts of our plan are, #1 Your Security (stealth), #2 Communication. We had over 400 items shipped on SR and EVERY package made it to its destination.<br/><br/>░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░<br/>#1=======YOUR SECURITY=======<br/>Cost is not an issue when it comes to packaging. We know that it is important to you as the buyer to receive a package that is free of suspicion. All packages are professionally labeled. Every package is triple sealed with additional visual layers of protection. Order from us with confidence.<br/><br/>#2=======COMMUNICATION=======<br/>If you have any questions feel free to ask. There is no such thing as a dumb question. If the product isn&#39;t great, we will let you know and we will price it accordingly. If the product isn&#39;t the best, we will let you know. You will always get what you pay for. If you feel that we could be doing something better let us know. This is one of our main policies, and this is why we feel that you will get the best from us when it comes to communication, stealth, and service. We are open to your suggestions. We take your best suggestions/tips/advice and make it our new policy.<br/><br/>=======SHIPPING=======<br/>Shipping is done on Tuesdays and Thursday<br/><br/>Priority mail, flat rate, 2 day boxes.<br/><br/>We take every necessary precaution when it comes to sending a professional looking package. Your package will arrive triple layered and professionally labeled.<br/><br/>We prefer to use PGP but it is not a requirement, we recommend that you learn to use PGP too, but it&#39;s up to you. If you want to use pivenote.com that&#39;s fine.<br/><br/>**ALWAYS use your correct information when it comes to shipping. If a package is not delivered because you failed to provide the correct information you will not be refunded. A postal worker will sometimes not deliver a package if they know that the name on the package does not belong to a person living at that address.<br/><br/>We do not sit there and type out your shipping labels. We simply copy/paste and print. Please make sure that your shipping information is formatted like this:<br/>(PLEASE DON&#39;T TYPE IN ALL CAPS) and make sure to use &quot;uppercase&quot; letters when appropriate.<br/>John Doe<br/>123 Anywhere Ln.<br/>&#83;pringfield, Mo 98765<br/><br/>=======PRODUCTS=======<br/>All of our cannabis is grown in Northern California.
