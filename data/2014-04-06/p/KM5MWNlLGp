    Very Flakey Shiny &quot;Party&quot; Blow. Nice &amp; Rocky. Unmatched quality for the price.<br/><br/>-International buyers: PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND THE BUYER CONTRACT. We require FE on international orders, in all cases, no &#101;xception. INTL ORDERS DO HAVE A WORLDWIDE TRACKING NUMBER &amp; We do get a customs number. We will provide only in an encrypted communication. This is for what we feel are obvious security reasons.<br/><br/>Our products are always of the highest quality, sourced at production level. We bring lifetimes of connections and experience to the deep web, and guarantee a professional, discrete &#116;ransaction and the highest quality products.<br/><br/>We are dedicated to making this experience great all the way around. We&#39;ve been learning our way around this new medium for our old business, and thank those who have helped us navigate our way, especially those who have been patient with us as we navigated a few initial challenges. All of this has helped us to reach our goal of same-day shipment of the highest quality products you can find, anywhere, period.<br/><br/>If you want a package deal, larger quantity, or have any other special request, just PM us, someone will get back to you and work something out.<br/><br/>Buyer/Seller Contract (PLEASE READ)<br/>This contract is entered into when you place and order, and both of us have certain responsibilities. Our responsibilities include the following: We are to package and ship your product using the best stealth methods available. We are NOT responsible for USPS &#101;rrors if the package is correctly labeled with buyer supplied address, including failure to deliver (carrier failure to locate address, USPS claim of &quot;undeliverable address&quot;, etc). We are NOT responsible if you, &quot;accidentally&quot; or otherwise, DESTROY YOUR OWN DRUGS after receiving your package. Your responsibility is to FINALIZE YOUR ORDER and give us a top rating EVEN IF THE USPS DO FUCK UP. We make every effort to expedite orders, but as security is paramount, WE DO NOT GUARANTEE OR MAKE ANY PROMISES REGARDING SHIPPING TIMES. We are responsible for, and will replace, any package that does not reach you due to an &#101;rror on our part. This includes a failure to check the waive signature box on an express package (we don&#39;t expect you to have to sign for anything, ever), or a package that is labelled differently than you have requested that does not reach you. In those cases, we will re-ship or refund you at your request. In the event of a re-ship or refund, we would still expect the highest rating for working to make it right with you. Mistakes on our end are very unusual, anyway. We provide amazing service, ultra fast shipping, and the best product anywhere. Give us a shot, and keep in mind this reasonable agreement when ordering. Thanks!<br/><br/>Shipping Guidelines, Tracking, Ordering Standards and Policies, etc.:<br/>Please read this before ordering, It applies to all orders, including active orders.<br/><br/>Ordering guidelines:<br/>-Overall Order Timeline-<br/>When ordering, consider the following. We make every effort to ship same day. We will ship within 24 hours of the first business day your order was posted. For example, if you order on Saturday at 3PM PST, we will try our best to get the order packed and shipped by Monday morning, but depending on circumstances, it may go out Monday night. While we prioritize expedited orders, expedited shipping requests still fall under these guidelines, because order volume and restocking product are the push and pull that we can&#39;t always control, as much as we want to. In nearly every case, your order will ship in a 24 hour period, and in many cases, we are able to get orders out within hours of posting. We just need to make it clear that if it is at all possible to plan ahead a bit, the whole &#112;rocess will be much less stressful for everyone. We do have tracking or customs numbers for each package. However, will will under no circumstances ever give you this number. We don&#39;t get it so you can track a package, and we don&#39;t track packages for you. We use these numbers only to resolve shipping disputes, should they arise. We wish we didn&#39;t have to get them at all, but unfortunately there are some scam artists in the dope scene. Please, please do not PM us to request the tracking information or customs number. Similarly, please do not PM us after the order with a request for us to track your package. We simply do not have time for these requests. WE WILL IGNORE PMS CONCERNING TRACKING PACKAGES OR INFORMATION ABOUT SHIPPING. If your order has been listed as shipped for 5 business days over the expected delivery time of the shipping service you requested and still has not arrived, you may then PM us and let us know, and we&#39;ll work to figure out what happened. More information about what to send us and that sort of thing can be found in the &quot;shipping problems&quot; section.<br/><br/>-Expedited Orders-<br/>Expedited orders include Express Mail or any request to compress shipping time to meet your needs. We understand the nature of the product, and know from personal experience that life can become uncomfortable (to put it mildly) when it isn&#39;t possible to plan ahead. WE CAN&#39;T ALWAYS MEET SUCH REQUESTS, BUT WE USUALLY DO. If we have an especially large number of express packages out, our shipping outlay can rapidly add up, and lack of finalization upon delivery has been a problem in a surprising number of cases. No need to PM with an Express order, simply include a note about the nature of your emergency in the address information area. We really do care about how you feel, and we&#39;re serious about trying to help you to prevent a crisis. However, our policy is to expedite every order as standard procedure, so clogging our inbox won&#39;t get your package out faster (and may even delay us).<br/><br/>-Shipping &quot;Problems&quot;-<br/>We&#39;ve found the #1 problem to be lack of patience. If you just follow our terms as outlined above, what you may think is a problem will likely just work itself out fine and your package will arrive within the time frame we&#39;ve outlined above. If it does not, and you&#39;ve waited for the time period we expect, you can then PM us and we&#39;ll work to figure out where your package is. We ask that once the time period we ask you to wait has elapsed, you please send us your zip code, the &#116;ransaction number, and number of days in transit. From there, we will look up the tracking information and do a bit of research to determine what the problem is. After that, we&#39;ll get back to you with what we&#39;ve found out.<br/><br/>-International Shipping-<br/>We do not like shipping internationally, and do so as a courtesy. International orders require FE, as we can&#39;t track them to delivery. If you do not wish to FE, do not order delivery to an international destination.<br/><br/>-Product Issues-<br/>We don&#39;t do refunds if you get your product. If there&#39;s a problem with product, one thing we know is that that problem will not be quality. That said, if you do have an issue, PM us and we&#39;ll work to resolve the issue to your satisfaction. Although we are superhuman robotic destruction machines, we&#39;re not perfect, so we may fuck up a little from time to time. We&#39;ll work to make you happy. On the other hand, don&#39;t come to us with a huge attitude, or act like you&#39;re at Nordstroms returning a blouse. Remember, this is still an illegal &#116;ransaction, not a dildo purchase. We all have to behave appropriately and keep our expectations in check.<br/><br/>Those are the rules. If you do not like them, do not order! Thanks for reading through the guideline, and thanks for your business!!
