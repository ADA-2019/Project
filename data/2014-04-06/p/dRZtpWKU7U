    Digital download sent via PM<br/><br/>Review from Amazon:<br/><br/>Dr. Cohen&#39;s book is an excellent introduction to the early research findings about LSD and to the &quot;LSD experience&quot;, itself. Dr. Cohen took part in research done at the Veteran&#39;s Administration Hospital in West L.A. in the 1950s. This book is not about the later psychedelic&#39; period of the late 1960s. He combines a scientific researcher&#39;s curiosity with an enthusiasm for the potential usefulness of some of LSD&#39;s properties. The book presents very interesting descriptions of the LSD experiences of some of the subjects in the VA experiments. He seems to be an advocate of continuing research, though I wonder what he must have thought of its wide recreational use a few years after the book appeared. In the book he states that his extensive interest never led him to take LSD. This surprised me at the time because of his positive reports of the LSD experience. I read the book when I was in an Army Reserve unit in which Dr. Cohen was an officer. I didn&#39;t think to talk to him about it at the time and hadn&#39;t any intention of taking LSD. Lo and behold, a few years later I became what might be called a &#39;clean hippy&#39; and eventually indulged in small amounts of LSD 5 or 6 times. Recently, I watched a short YouTube segment of a woman at the VA in the 1950s, a district attorney&#39;s wife, I believe, taking the drug in the presence of Dr. Cohen, who was questioning her at various stages. As she became intoxicated by the drug&#39;s extraordinary affects, she asked Dr. Cohen whether he could see the images she was seeing. He sat there smiling in a nice way, but said, no, that he couldn&#39;t. She began to withdraw a little bit, convinced, as I would have been, that he wasn&#39;t really experiencing the &quot;real reality&quot; of LSD and of life and existence itself - which is the essence of the LSD experience. I was disappointed that he seemed to think so highly of the drug yet didn&#39;t want to experience it just once. In the book, one subject reports that taking LSD was the greatest experience of his life, but responded to the question of taking it again, by saying, no. The reasoning that followed was that he had had the experience and it would always reside within him - he didn&#39;t need to re-experience it. I agree. But, also, in the days when I was still young enough to be around others who were interested in LSD and probably able to find some, I didn&#39;t recommend to anyone I knew that they take it. I felt that it was irresponsible to tell anyone to take one pill knowing that that pill would likely change their life and make them a slightly different person forever. I felt that taking LSD made me a slightly different person in everything I&#39;d ever do thereafter. I&#39;m not convinced that that is true, but it may be. One professor I spoke with said his limited LSD experience was very positive but that he was less able to do research in his (unrelated) field for a number of months afterwards. If you&#39;ve never taken LSD, by all means read this fascinating book. It is a serious book and not meant to seduce the reader into becoming an advocate for the drug. If you&#39;ve taken LSD this book will perhaps add only a little to your understanding.
