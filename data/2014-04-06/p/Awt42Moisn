    This is Medabon.  Below is a PARTIAL transcript of the prescribing information included with the product.  Non-critical information has been withheld to meet space limitations and noted wherein.  This transcript is intended as a supplement to your own research.<br/>-BEGIN TRANSCRIPT-<br/>For use by a qualified medical professional<br/>Prescribing Information<br/>MEDABON<br/>1. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION<br/>MEDABON is a combination therapy containing one tablet of mifepristone 200 mg and four tablets of misoprostol 200 micrograms.<br/>Mifepristone tablet for oral administration: light yellow, circular, biconvex, uncoated tablet plain on both sides.<br/>Misoprostol tablet for vaginal administration: white to off-white, rectangular shaped, uncoated tablet debossed with &quot;square on either side of breakline&quot; on one side and plain on the other side<br/>[WITHHELD]<br/>4. INDICATIONS<br/>Medabon is indicated for medical termination of developing intra-uterine pregnancy of up to 63 days gestation.<br/>5. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION<br/>MEDABON can only be prescribed by qualified medical professionals who are able to assess the gestational age of an ebryo and to diagnose ectopic pregnancies.  The qualified medical professionals must also be able to provide surgical intervention in cases of incomplete abortion or severe bleeding, or have made plans to provide such care through others, and be able to assure patient access to medical facilities equipped to provide blood transfusions and resuscitation, if necessary.<br/>Day 1 (First visit):  Mifepristone administration<br/>One tablet of mifepristone (200 mg) is taken in a single oral dose under the supervision of a qualified medical professional in a clinic, medical office or hospital.<br/>Day 3 (Second visit):  Misoprostol administration<br/>The patient returns to the clinic, medical office or hospital two days (24-48 hours) after ingesting the pifepristone tablet.  The patient takes four 200-microgram tablets (800 micrograms) of misoprostol vaginally.  Misoprostol tablets can be administered by a health care provider (place two tablets on each side of the cervix in vaginal vault) or by the woman herself.  The woman should be instructed to clean her hands thouroughly before inserting the misoprostol tablets as high as possible into the vagina, and remain recumbent for at least 30 minutes.<br/>During the period immediately following the administration of misoprostol, the patient may need medication for cramps or gastrointestinal symptoms.  The patient should be given instructions on what to do if significant discomfort, excessive bleeding or other adverse reactions occur and should be given a phone number to call if she has questions following the administration of misoprostol.<br/>Day 10 to 14 (Third visit):  Post-treatment examination<br/>Patients must return to the clinic, medical office or hospital within 10 to 14 days after the administration of mifepristone.  This visitis very important to confirm by clinical examination or ultrasonographic scan that a complete termination of pregnancy has occurred.<br/>Patients who have an ongoing pregnancy at this visit have a ris of foetal malformation resulting from the treatment.  Surgical termination is recommended to manage medical abortion treatment failures.<br/>6. CONTRAINDICATIONS<br/>MEDABON SHOULD NEVER be prescribed in the following situations:<br/>chronic adrenal failure<br/>hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients<br/>previous known allergy to prostaglandins<br/>severe asthma uncontrolled by therapy<br/>inherited porphyria<br/>pregnancy not confimed by gynaecological examination, ultrasound scan or biological tests<br/>pregnancy beyond 63 days gestation<br/>confirmed or suspected extra-uterine pregnancy<br/>[WITHHELD]<br/>7. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS:<br/>Warnings:<br/>In the absense of specific studies, mifepristone is not recommended in patients with renal failure, hepatic failure or malnutrition<br/>Patients with prosthetic heart valves or who have had one previous episode of infective endocarditis should receive chemoprophylaxis.<br/>[WITHHELD]<br/>The expulsion may take place before misoprostol administration (in 1 to 2 percent of cases).  This does not preclude the follow-up visit in order to check that the abortion is complete.<br/>Risks related to the method:<br/>Failures:<br/>The non-negligible risk of failure, which occurs in 1.3 to 4.6 percent of the cases, makes the follow-up visit mandatory in order to check that the abortion is complete.<br/>The patient should be informed that surgical treatment may be required to complete abortion, although the risk is low.<br/>Bleeding:<br/>The patient must be informed of the occurrence of prolonged vaginal bleeding (an average of about 13 days after mifepristone intake, up to three weeks in some women).  In a few cases, heavy bleeding may require surgical evacuation of the uterus.  Bleeding occurs also in most cases of failure and is not in any way proof of termination of pregnancy.<br/>The patient should be informed not to travel far away from the prescribing centre as long as complete expulstion has not been recorded.  She will receive precise instructions as to whom she should contact and where to go, in the event of any problems or emergency, particularly in the case of very heavy vaginal bleeding.<br/>A follow-up visit must take place within a period of 10 to 14 days after administration of mifepristone to verify by the appropriate means (clinical examination, ultrasound scan, or beta-hCG measurement) that expulsion has been completed and that vaginal bleeding has stopped or substantially reduced.  In case of persistent bleeding (even light) beyond the follow-up visit, its disappearance should be checked a few weeks later.  If an ongoing pregnancy is suspected, a further ultrasound scan may be required to evaluate its viability.<br/>Persistence of vaginal bleeding at this point could signify incomplete abortion, or an unnoticed extra-uterine pregnancy, and appropriate investigation/treatment should be considered.<br/>In the event of continuing pregnancy diagnosed at the follow-up visit, termination by another method will be proposed to the woman.<br/>Since heavy bleeding requiring haemostatic curettage occurs in .2 to 1.8 percent of the cases duringthe medical method of pregnancy termination, special care should be given to patients with haemostatic disorders with hypocoagulability, or with anaemia.  The decision to use the medical or the surgical method should be decided with specialised consultants according to the type of haemostatic disorder and the level of anaemia.<br/>Infection:<br/>The genital tract is more susceptible to ascending infection when the cervix is dilated after abortion or childbirth.  There are few data on the incidence of clinically significant pelvic infection after medical abortion, but it seems to be rare and probably occurs less often than after vacuum aspiration.  Many of the symptoms of pelvic infection, such as pain, are rather non-specific and hence precise diagnosis is difficult.  Women with clinical signs such as pelvic pain, abdominal or adnexal tenderness, vaginal discharge and fever should be treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.<br/>[WITHHELD]<br/>Other risks:<br/>Pregnancy-related symptoms such as nausea and vomiting may increase after misoprostol administration, and they will weaken and disappear during the abortion &#112;rocess.  Lower abdominal pain and cramping are the most common symptoms and they are related to misoprostol administration and abortion &#112;rocess.  If pain persists after expultion of the products of conception, its origin should be investigated.  Diarrhoea is the most common dose-related side-effect relatd to misoprostol use whichnormally does not require treatment.  Some women also report chills, shivering and/or temperature rise after misoprostol administration.<br/>Other risks are those of the surgical procedure.<br/>Regarding rhesus determination and prevention of rhesus allo-immunisation the same general measures apply to the use of mifepristone as taken during any termination of pregnancy.<br/>Any reproductive tract infection should be treated before the medical abortion regimen is administered.<br/>During clinical trials, pregnancies have occurred between abortion and resumption of meses.  To avoid potential exposure of a subsequent pregnancy to mifepristone, it is recommended that conception be avoided after abortion.  Reliable contraceptive methods should therefore be started as early as possible after misoprostol administration.<br/>Precautions:<br/>[WITHHELD]<br/>8.  DRUG INTERACTIONS<br/>No interaction studies have been performed in view of the single dose administration.  On the basis of mifepristone&#39;s metabolism by CYP3A4, it is possible that ketoconazole, itraconazole, erthromycin, and grapefruit juice may inhibit its metabolism (increasing serum levels of mifepristone).  Furthermore, rifampicin, dexamethasone, St. John&#39;s Wort and certain anticonvulsants (phenytion, phenobarbital, carbamazepine) may induce mifepristone metabolism (lowering serum levels of mifepristone).<br/>[WITHHELD]<br/>9.  PREGNANCY AND LACTATION<br/>Pregnancy:<br/>[WITHHELD]<br/>Lactation:<br/>Mifepristone is a lipophilic compound and may theoretically be excreted in the mother&#39;s breast milk.  However, no data is available.  Consequently, MEDABON use should be avoided during breast-feeding.<br/>10.  UNDESIRABLE EFFECTS<br/>Urogenital<br/>Bleeding: Heavy bleeding occurs in up to 5 percent of the cases and may require haemostatic curettage and blood transfusion in up to 1.8 percent of the cases.<br/>Very common uterine contractions or cramping (up to 70-80 percent) in the hours following misoprostol intake.<br/>[WITHHELD]
