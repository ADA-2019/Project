    For those who would like to personalize their Changa to their own taste and mood I have set up this listing. Here you can choose your favorite herbs and i will convert them into your personal Changa.<br/><br/>Simply pick up to five of the listed herbs and ad the numbers to your address information. When leaving your review about your personal changa experience please ad the combination of herbs you ordered so that future customers have something to go on.<br/><br/>example: #3 - #8 - #14 - #10 - #6<br/>John Doe<br/>Triplane 21<br/>etc. etc.<br/><br/>When infused with particular herbs DMT evolves into an almost completely different experience. Electrically charged depth, colour and feeling ooze through you like a hot knife through butter, the herbs bring more into the experience than you could imagine possible. It is so easy to breakthrough, so simple to use and simply so amazing! Overall, any person who considers themselves a DMT enthusiast has to attempt this method of smoking at least once; in all honesty though it&#39;s the only way to fly.<br/><br/>The effects of Changa are considered by many to be more grounded than just DMT freebase smoked on its own. The effects have been reported as being similar to a short Ayahuasca trip. The duration of effects is slightly longer than that of freebase DMT, with reports of trips lasting up to 25 minutes. There have also been reports of Changa being used in conjunction with Ayahuasca to intensify and then later revisit the experience. Rolling changa into a joint is also a very relaxing way of crossing over to the other side.<br/><br/>All my changa recipes consist of 55% dmt and 5% harmine freebase extract (equal to 20% regular harmine) which makes it the strongest and longest lasting changa you will find anywhere.<br/><br/>The choices are as following:<br/><br/>#1 *Motherwort*<br/>Motherwort is recognized for its relaxing effect on the body. The primary effects of Motherwort when smoked is a mild euphoria lasting approximately 20 minutes. The after effects are a light sense of lost time.<br/><br/>#2 *Artemesia Absinthium*<br/>Artemesia Absinthium is an inebriating pipe full - it is also used to make the fabled psychoactive beverage called absinthe, which was very popular in the late 19th century. This drink was a favorite of many artists and intellectuals of the time. When smoked Artemesia Absinthium invigorates the senses and creates an intense, unhurried sense of well being. Edgar Allen Poe loved it, and look what he accomplished.<br/><br/>#3 *Yerba Santa*<br/>Yerba Santa- also known as Mountain Balm, Bishop wort, Purple betony, Holy Herb, Bear Plant, Saint&#39;s Herb, and Indian Chewing Gum.<br/>Yerba santa is traditionally a relaxing calming smoke. It is a sacred herb that is an excellent smoke for ceremony, ritual, meditation, divination or personal use.<br/>The effects of smoking Santa is an experience of awakening, and a deep claiming of the soul which is why it is often referred to as the Holy herb.<br/><br/>#4 *Passiflora*<br/>The Spanish explorers first introduced Europeans to South America&#39;s Passion Flower in the 1500&#39;s. It was treasured it for its calming, soothing qualities. Native Americans in the South also utilized this exotic vine&#39;s leaves in a similar manner. American eclectic physicians used it clinically, and it has now gained official acceptance in European countries.<br/><br/>#5 *Damiana*<br/>Damiana is known for its relaxing impact that dates back as far back as the Maya culture. Damiana as a smoke produces a mild euphoric type of high that can last for 1 to 1 1/2 hours. It has also been used as an aphrodisiac.<br/><br/>#6 *Mugwort*<br/>Mugwort - aka The Dreaming Herb is valued for Calming the conscious mind. It is also used Meditation &amp; Dream Quests. Mugwort is an invigorating and aromatic herb with astringent qualities.<br/><br/>#7 *Sassafras Rootbark*<br/>Sassafras Root Bark is highly aromatic and inebriating.<br/>Sassafras was used as the original flavoring for root beer but because sassafras contains safrole, it cannot be sold in the U.S. for human consumption. Safrole is an MDMA precursor and is itself psychoactive. Sassafras generates an extremely sweet-spicy smoke.<br/><br/>#8 *Pot Marigold*<br/>Pot marigold has been known to bring better dreams while you sleep. it is also supposed to help in remembering dreams more clearly, in addition to assiting in their interpretation.<br/><br/>#9 *Humulus lupulus*<br/>Humulus lupulus is a sedative and mood enhancer. It can be smoked or can be made into a tea.<br/>This herb is a member of the Cannabinaceae family and as such produces &quot;familiar effects&quot; when smoked. Many customers have reported when smoking Humulus lupulus they experienced a hypnotic / euphoric like effect.<br/><br/>#10 *Mint*<br/>Mint has been used for centuries for a variety of medical conditions and other ailments.The stimulating scent of mint can ease the symptoms of stress by inducing a sense of calm. Its antispasmodic activity and sedative properties can ease tension while abating minor muscle aches and pain.<br/><br/>#11 *Nettle*<br/>Nettle Leaf AKA Nettles is a extremely rare and exotic herb. It has a reputation for being a strong and stimulating smoking herb.<br/><br/>#12 *Yerba Green*<br/>Yerba Green is a herb made from the leaves and tender stems of a powerful rainforest tree, discovered centuries ago by the indigenous people in South America.<br/>It is native to the subtropical rainforests of Paraguay, Brazil and Argentina. The tea which is made from these leaves is revered to as the &ldquo;drink of the gods&rdquo; and consumed to ensure health, vitality, and longevity, Yerba Green triumphs as nature&rsquo;s most balanced stimulant.<br/><br/>#13 *Eucalyptus*<br/>Eucalyptus is an aromatic herb that stimulates the system, a decongestant and expectorant that relaxes the muscles and lowers fever. It also has antibiotic properties.<br/><br/>#14 *Calamus*<br/>Calamus Root has traditionally been smoked, eaten, or brewed into a tea. The Cree say that they can take Calamus root and &#39;travel great distances without touching the ground&#39;, so you can imagine what kind of smoke this herb is.<br/><br/>#15 *Lavender*<br/>Lavender Flower is recognized worldwide for its relaxing effect on the body. It is used in calming depression, hysteria, freedom from worries and concerns. Increases concern for your own well being and health. Relaxes when stressed, tense and mild anxiety.<br/><br/>Enjoy!<br/>Lucid Gentleman
