            Offsite Email (if Agora is unavailable): angelojos@safe-mail.net<br/><br/>Agora Review Thread: http://i4rx33ibdndtqayh.onion/index.&#112;hp/topic,1337<br/><br/>The Hub Review Thread: http://thehubaoydxrommh.onion/index.&#112;hp?topic=2200.0<br/><br/>-----------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Welcome to Angel Eyes,<br/><br/>We are a small collective of affiliated, indoor, organic, hydroponic marijuana cultivators and small, private breeders specializing in our favorite strains of mj.<br/><br/>The collective&#39;s plants receive top shelf handling from growth to drying to curing and storage. These &#112;rocesses, along with our careful strain selection, are what make the biggest difference in whether the end user gets something extraordinary to smoke.<br/><br/>The short reason to buy from us is if you want unique strains with unique properties and varied highs that are noteworthy and handled with connoisseur level care from the time they are grown and harvested to when it arrives in your post. We&#39;re a collective with much experience and praise between us who care about what we put out and are always looking for new strains that attract our interest and admiration. This last part is where we really are into customer suggestions and will be having polls or other voting to let us know what you guys are interested in seeing on the menu and have plans to, with your help, grow our stable of marijuana genetics.<br/><br/>One thing you might notice about our listings is that we always list cure-lengths of the strains we offer.  Strain/genetic expression and quality inputs (nutrients and plant care) are two of the three important elements to amazing weed.  The post &#112;rocess handling (a/k/a proper drying and curing of weed) has an enormous impact on the quality, length and clarity of high, strength, clean come-down, smoothness and flavor, &#98;asically everything about the experience is affected.<br/><br/>Put another way, a strain with a 1 month cure versus the same strain with a 3-4 month cure will look, smell, taste and, most importantly affect you, differently.  Its kind-of comparable to the difference between a new wine and a very fine vintage wine.<br/><br/>Thus, in our listings you will see the age of cure listed as prominently as the strain name and weight on offer.  Often, longer-cured product will go for higher price.<br/><br/>The minimum amount of cure time we put on our buds is two weeks.<br/><br/>For pain relief we recommend our long-cured indica-dominant or hybrid strains, especially the UV-dried &#118;ersions.<br/><br/>Another thing we love to do is offer strains and different cures in combo packs so our customers can really experiment.  We will be selecting the combinations based on our experience of complimentary strains that work well as blends as well as combos that simply offer you the experience to sample variety or different cure-lengths for the same strain.<br/><br/>A couple of final points:<br/><br/>- Yes, even if you have no feedback we will sell to you.  Everyone needs to get a start at some point, and we prefer to begin customer relationships with trust and mutual respect.<br/><br/>- We won&#39;t normally ask you to finalize early.  We ask that you finalize when you receive and sample your order as we love to read descriptive feedback.<br/><br/>- Our policy is that if anyone has an issue with their order they must contact us before leaving negative feedback as we would like the chance to correct any problems.  If you leave negative feedback before offering us a chance to correct the issue you may be added to the vendor blacklist and many vendors won&#39;t sell to you.<br/><br/>- We are not currently selling in bulk, nor are we offering discounts for any amounts over a half ounce.<br/><br/>- We understand that our prices are on the higher end, however we are offering a labor, material and time-intensive product that adds significantly to the cost of production.  If you are not sure that our product is worth the extra cost to you, we recommend purchasing a small amount first to see.<br/><br/>- Below is a descriptive list of our current house strains. Enjoy.<br/><br/>Your Proprietress,<br/>Ava<br/><br/><br/>----------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>STRAINS<br/><br/>Chemdawg X G13 (Dr Greenthumb)<br/>Sativa Dominant<br/><br/>Chemdawg and G13, both sativa-dominant (80/20 each) classics, combine to give this strain a truly energizing and soaring high combined with a mellow body buzz that is unusual for such a strong sativa. This combination is very special because, unlike many high THC strains that cause a racy, paranoid feeling, this phenotype keeps you grounded with its warm buzz while your head goes soaring into the stratosphere. Its a very clean and clear high with heightened visual perception and shimmering, and avoids the heart-racing/paranoia-inducing tendency of many commercial sativas. It imparts an active and interested motivation, is great for socializing and enhances conversation and thought. Its excellent genetics and pungent, Chemdawg aroma and taste are hard to beat. <br/><br/>The UV-dried &#118;ersion of this strain has more depth, more of a body buzz, but still retains almost all of the clarity and energy of the traditional dried variety.<br/><br/><br/>The Big Lebowksi<br/>Indica/sativa blend.<br/><br/>Over the years, pot has gotten a lot stronger, especially with the advent of indoor hydroponic growing under metal halide and high pressure sodium lamps.  The Big Lebowksi is a happy, sweet, hazy high with a soft but strong buzz that harkens back to past decades when weed was an accompaniment to life&#39;s sweet times, not the main event itself.  This strain is strong but it takes it easy with you in a way that many indoor strains don&#39;t nowadays.  It has a citrus taste that softens with a longer cure and is very smooth.<br/><br/>Its narcotic effects heighten with a longer cure but even a long cure won&#39;t put you to sleep.  And as with many strains the longer cure maintains its buzz and warmth for longer and stronger.  This &#118;ersion of this strain is UV-dried for extra body and extra wow.<br/><br/>&quot;Classic Big Lebowksi&quot; (2-3 week cure)<br/><br/>This &#118;ersion of our popular Big Lebowski strain was not dried with UV light, unlike our regular offering.  This is the strain as we used to sell it and as many of us here at Angel Eyes prefer it.  It is a less relaxing, more psychedelic and potent &#118;ersion of the plant, though the &#98;asic character remains the same.  For more information please read the note below the strain description.<br/><br/><br/>Northern Lights 5 X Afghan (Mr. Nice)(UV-dried)<br/><br/>This cross has a reputation among the marijuana growing community as one of the best strong indica strains around.  As sativa lovers we were only interested in this strain so that we could have a high quality indica for our customers who are seeking pain relief.  So we were greatly surprised and delighted when we started testing these plants.  This cross is extremely relaxing, and the body high is really very strong.  We personally don&#39;t use marijuana for pain so its hard for us to judge how it would work, but given the strength of the body high we believe it will be very effective.  We are UV-drying it which will enhance its pain-relieving and relaxing properties.  What really surprised us was that while the high is very relaxing it doesn&#39;t really cause a couch-lock effect.  If you are tired it will help you to get to sleep, but otherwise it actually allows for watching a movie, listening to music or quiet conversation quite well.  The head is not muddy or addled and you won&#39;t feel dull-witted or forgetful.  And the come-down is one of the best I&#39;ve ever encountered -- almost no &quot;pot hangover&quot; or body discomfort, and little fatigue.<br/><br/>The taste is also incredible.  Its hard to describe the smell -- its almost sweet with an undertone of coriander or curry spice, and some muskiness as well.  It also has a &quot;flowery&quot; bouquet that might be attributable to the massive number of hairs adorning every inch of the buds, and it is smooth beyond belief.  <br/><br/><br/>AK-47 (Serious Seeds)<br/><br/>The one and only AK-47, winner and runner up in over ten major marijuana competitions, including 6 2nd/3rd place Cannabis Cup awards.  Serious Seeds&#39; AK is the true AK, and we are very happy to finally have this strain in our stable.  We were initially turned on to this strain by a friend a few years ago, and were amazed at its clarity, strength and pungent aroma.  For motivation, energy and focus AK simply can&#39;t be beat.  There are a lot of sativas out there that can get your motor running, but most of them have the tendency to cloud the head and leave a dirty energy after a short time.  The other major pitfall with commercial sativa/sativa-like strains is paranoia.  Our AK-47 manages to avoid these pitfalls.  While it does get the heart going like any good sativa we have yet to experience anything close to paranoia or anxiety, and its clarity is something you have to experience to believe.  The taste is pungent, piney and aromatic, and it pulls smooth and sweet.<br/><br/>Kali Mist (Serious Seeds)<br/>90% Sativa<br/><br/>Kali Mist is a long-blooming sativa with an incredible spicy aroma and a super-potent head high that can literally blow your mind. The gossip surrounding this strain is that Kali was specially developed by a select group of breeders as a pain relieving strain especially for women. Its an odd story because sativas are not known for their pain relieving qualities. However, many women do claim that it is excellent for menstrual cramps, and our experience is that it does have an unusually strong and energetic body buzz, especially for a sativa. Kali Mist won the Cannabis Cup twice and placed once: 1995 - 1st place &quot;Hydro Cup&quot;, 2000 - 1st place &quot;Sativa Cup&quot; &amp; 2002 - 3rd place &quot;Sativa Cup&quot;. In our opinion the awards are well-earned.<br/><br/>The two week cure is sufficient, though it will strengthen and get smoother with a longer cure.<br/><br/>One important thing we wish to mention is that many sativas, Kali included, are fluffy, airy buds. They often have fewer visible trichomes, though anyone with real knowledge of MJ will tell you that trichome counts do not equate with bud potency. If you only like dense, hard nugs that are frosty as hell, you may want to avoid our sativas, especially the Kali. I would mention that this would be a mistake because you will be missing out on a very special high, but we want our customers to be informed so they are not disappointed with what they receive.<br/><br/><br/>Grape Phenotype Bogglegum (Bubblegum by Bog)(UV-dried)<br/>Hybrid<br/><br/>The Bogglegum grape is a rare phenotype and is the strain that &#98;asically all of us love.  Its an indica sativa blend, with very special qualities on both sides. It smells like grape bubblegum right off the plant, is sweet and fruity with a shorter cure (2wks - 2 mos), changes to a headier scent of wine with an increased cure (3-6 months).<br/><br/>With a shorter cure the head experiences a very sweet active mental heightening with a quiet confidence.  One friend swears he saw a bush burning after smoking a pinner of some medium cured Bog.  The body buzz is special and definitely gets you seriously stoned, though not a couch-lock kind of stone.  It won&#39;t make you dizzy or dumb, and the high lasts a good long time.<br/><br/>With a long cure it gives a strong narcotic-feeling high, and a soaring head, but you may not feel like doing much but closing your eyes, lying down and getting psychedelic with some music or something.  The long cure has serious pain relieving qualities, and also strongly enhances the pain relieving and body calming qualities of other medications.<br/><br/>More strains to follow soon...<br/><br/><br/>----------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>EVERYTHING ELSE:<br/><br/>FEEDBACK<br/><br/>When leaving feedback please do not mention shipping times or anything that could be used to indicate either your location, our location or the exact date shipped.
