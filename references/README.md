##### 1.3 Research Design

To design a research, one should have the following apporach :

- [ ] Observing Behavior - Take a first look at the data and try to come up with a way to describe the subject behavior with respect to some features. If nothing emerges, maybe change the choice in features. Otherwise, use the observations for the next point
- [ ] Asking Questions - In the light of the previous observation, try to come up with relevant questions on the behavior.
- [ ] Running Experiment - Define and run an experiment(s) that would answer the question(s)


##### 2.3 Ten common characteristics of big data


- [x] Big - Not an end in itself but can enable the research on rare/ponctual events, good.
- [ ] Always-On
- [x] Non-Reactive - measurement of the data did not have an impact on the data itself (behavior, structure)
- [x] Incomplete - Keep in mind results might be biased by incompleteness. Look for ways to fill gaps, take results with a grain of salt
- [ ] Nonrepresentative
- [x] Drifting - "many big data sources are drifting because of changes in who is using them, in how they are being used, and in how the systems work".
- [ ] Algorithmically confounded
- [x] Dirty - "the best way to avoid being fooled by dirty data is to understand as much as possible about how your data were created."
- [ ] Sensitive


##### 2.4 Research strategies

- ###### Counting Things
> May seem trivial but often a good source of insight, if the right things are counted

- ###### Nowcasting
> "Predict the present" : Come up with a descriptive model that can be used to predict the situation described by the data. Using real data to create the model, it can easily be verified. Then it can be used to create estimates by playing with the parameters.

- ###### Approximating Experiments
> In social studies, it's usually virtually impossible to control all the parameters for a given experiment : human beings tend to be more complex than the parameters taken into account for the experiment. In that regard, a good way to guarantee the significance of an experiment results is to proceed by "randomized controlled experiment". Use a natural set of data (i.e. not measured in the context of an experiment but in real life condition) and take random subset of subjects for study. This random aspect strengthen the meaning of any "casual inference" that could be proposed with the obtained result. \
> Look for an event that might have had an influence on some subject, and not on others, this is a "natural experiment" : come up with a model to describe an experiment that naturally took place and use the related data for the research studies.
