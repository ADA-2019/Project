##### 1.3 Research Design

To design a research, one should have the following apporach :
	
	- [ ] Observing Behavior - Take a first look at the data and try to come up with a way to describe the subject behavior with respect to some features. If nothing emerges, maybe change the choice in features. Otherwise, use the observations for the next point
	- [ ] Asking Questions - In the light of the previous observation, try to come up with relevant questions on the behavior.
	- [ ] Running Experiment - Define and run an experiment(s) that would answer the question(s)


##### 2.3 Ten common characteristics of big data


	- [x] Big - Not an end in itself but can enable the research on rare/ponctual events, good.
	- [ ] Always-On
	- [x] Non-Reactive - measurement of the data did not have an impact on the data itself (behavior, structure)
	- [x] Incomplete - Keep in mind results might be biased by incompleteness. Look for ways to fill gaps, take results with a grain of salt
	- [ ] Nonrepresentative
	- [x] Drifting - "many big data sources are drifting because of changes in who is using them, in how they are being used, and in how the systems work". 
	- [ ] Algorithmically confounded
	- [x] Dirty - "the best way to avoid being fooled by dirty data is to understand as much as possible about how your data were created."
	- [ ] Sensitive
