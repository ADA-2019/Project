                        Since it's first appearance in 2009, the term "Deep Web" has designated the non-indexed parts of the World Wide Web, that is by standard search engine. Using the development of a FOSS anonymity network software called TOR, a whole digital world was born
                        and has been growing ever since. Making the best out of the anonymity that is provided to them, TOR users have, over the time, developed complex infrastructure in this deep web to make the discussion, the advertisement and the
                        purchase of any service or item that would be deemed illegal by local authorities, accessible to all.
                        <br><br> With this new kind of distribution, law enforcement had to adapt in order to regulate these illicit markets. On 5 and 6 November 2014 an international law enforcement operation targeting darknet markets and other hidden
                        services operating on the Tor network was launch, <strong class="text-white">Operation Onymous</strong>, the operation involved the police forces of 17 countries, more than 400 sites were closed and 17 arrests were made.
                        <br><br> If the anonymity factor remains intact, tools have been developed to scrape and archive most services available on the TOR network. From forums to marketplaces, including search engines, messaging services, etc. This Project
                        will try to get an overview of the impact of huge raids such as Operation Onymous on the darknet uses, focusing on one marketplace that survived the operation, <strong class="text-white">Agora</strong> market.

                            We will first examine the impact of Onymous on the products listed on Agora Market. At first glance, it can be assumed that a large-scale police operation on an illegal market can frighten its actors and thus impact its functioning. We will focus here
                            on the evolution of the number of products available in the store, the different types of products, their prices and finally, we will try to understand if this operation had an impact on the import/export of the products, and
                            if the sellers paid more attention to the countries where the products were shipped.

                    <h2><strong>Market size</strong></h2>
                    <p align="justify">
                        Here we propose to study the availability of products over time, we can see a sharp drop in the number of listings available on the market per day just at the time of the Operation Onymous, however it recovers very quickly, less than a week later and
                        if we look at the graph over a longer period, we see that this drop is relatively small and is part of the market fluctuations. Although a decrease in the number of products available has been measured, Operation Onymous does not
                        seem to have a significant impact on product availability on a large scale.

                        We then decided to divide the products into categories and see if their sales were all affected by the Operation Onymous in the same way. Again, we find that the operation led to a decrease in sales, but soon after the Onymous, the market returns
                        to normal. We notice here that Drugs constitute the major products listed on the market.

                        The evolution of the price of the product is an interesting fact to examine after that. Since the trade is in Bitcoin, a crypto currency that fluctuates a lot, we convert the price into USD, based on the exchange rate of the corresponding day. Counter-intuitively,
                        the price seems to decrease after the Operation Onymous. The overall trend after the operation is clearly a decrease, where it was a clear increase before the Operation Onymous.

                            We then turned our attention to the origin of the products and export flows. Intuitively, we can think that this kind of policing operation has an impact on the number of products exported abroad or from/to certain countries in particular.

                            products sent from this area. Between each arc are represented flows and the width of the projection of each flow on an arc represents the proportion of product sent from this arc. Finally, the fluxes take the colour of the
                            arc that sends the most product. You can click on one of the continents to view the details of its exports.

                            We can see here that the two main global players are Europe and the United States, they share more than 65% of the market. If we look at the proportion of products sent locally, it is interesting to see that some areas are more focus on domestic transactions
                            than others, we take for example Oceania which sends approximately 70% of its products to Oceania and Europe which exports approximately 70% of its products to other areas, this could be explained by the strict control policy
                            of the Australian borders. Unfortunately there is no big change in these proportions after Operation Onymous, Europe has lost market share to the United States but overall the figures remain the same. This analysis is tempered
                            since only a small part of the products have a country of origin and destination displayed.

                            If we take a closer look at the import/export traffic, we can see one clear trend after Onymous strike in the exportation plot. We can see a clear fall in worldwide exportations after the attack. The breakup is pretty clear, it might be the result of
                            sellers getting scared of wide operation, and changing to a more local type of market. However this trend is poctual since, the number of worldwide exportations starts growing again 1 month after the Operation Onymous.
                        </p>
                        <p align="justify">
                            We can also notice the tiny simultaneous drops in the product origin plot. This drop is directly related to the total number of product available on Agora. But as said earlier this fluctuation could be part of the usual fluctuation of the market, or even
                            some noise in the parsing.

                            <b>[ WiP ]</b> From the produce analysis we cannot conclude much, the impact of the Operation Onymous seems small or even insugnificant. The market size drop is very subtile to the extend it could be usual fluctuations. However,
                            there is a clear trend inversion for the average price of the products available. This change is stil to be explained, since we could not find some rationnal cause behind it. Finally, we could notice a temporary slow down in
                            worlwide exportation. It can be easily explained by sellers being more carefull after the attack, reducing the risk of customs derequisition.

                        We saw that the <strong> onymous </strong> operation resulted in a drop in the number of products. To understand why this number was decreasing, we analyzed the number of active suppliers on Agora (a supplier is considered "active"
                        when he has certain products to sell on a given day). Indeed, the sellers who sold the retired products disappeared from the market after this event. More than 27% (311) of the active vendors stopped selling definitively that day,
                        and the market never recover until july 2015 when it permanently closed.

                        Operation <strong>Onymous</strong> had an huge impact on the number of vendors on the Agora market, but how can we explain that the number of products listed on agora recovered so quickly. First of all, we notice here that the
                        vendors that left after Onymous are, in majority, small suppliers (~8 products to sell) compare to those who stayed (with ~20 listed products). In addition, we find that the number of products listed by these large suppliers is growing
                        faster than the rest of the suppliers after Onymous.

                        While the <strong> Onymous </strong> operation has had a significant negative impact on the total number of suppliers in the Agora market, it has also closed other large markets, such as Silkroad, so we can ask ourselves if the
                        closing of these markets entails moving users to Agora. We can see here that this is not the case, the number of new suppliers who publish a product each day is relatively stable, about 5 per day. A vendor is considered new the
                        day when he publish is first product.

                            We saw that the <strong>Onymous</strong> operation had a significant impact on the suppliers of Agora Market, a lot of small vendors retired after this operation. In another hand, the operation didn't seem to impact the big
                            suppliers of Agora. We assume that these conclusion are true for other market such as Silkroad : the small suppliers left after it was close and the big suppliers continue their deals on other platforms. But if this is the case,
                            how can we explain that we don't see any upward trend in the number of new suppliers after the operation on Agora ? We made the assumption that it was because most of the big suppliers had already an account on several market.
                            We compared the username of the suppliers present on Agora and Silkroad before Onymous and found out that 15% of them had an account on both market. In order to compare usernames, since some times sellers use slightly different
                            name (Uppercase letters, number instead of letters, etc..) we also compared them with an hamming distance equal or inferior to 1 and lowercased all usernames. With hamming distance we have more than x% usernames matches.

                            In conclusion, we have seen that Operation Onymous did not have a huge impact on the market as it went back to normal shortly after Operation Onymous.
                            However it leads to interesting changes on the vendors behalf : the small suppliers tend to quit the market while the bigger ones seem to grow.
                            One could then ask if the operation was a success since it reduce the number of vendors but it advantages the bigger ones who are supposedly the hardest to arrest.
