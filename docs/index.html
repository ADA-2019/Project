						<p>
							Since its first appearance in 2009, the term "Deep Web" has designated the non-indexed parts of the World Wide Web, that is by standard search engine. Using the development of a FOSS anonymity network software called TOR , a whole digital world was born and has been growing ever since. Making the best out of the anonymity that is provided to them, TOR users have, over the time, developed complex infrastructure in this Deep Web to make the discussion, the advertisement and the purchase of any service or item that would be deemed illegal by local authorities, accessible to all.

							<strong>Context: </strong>
							With this new kind of distribution, law enforcement had to adapt in order to regulate these illicit markets. On 5 and 6 November 2014 an international law enforcement operation targeting darknet markets and other hidden services operating on the Tor network was launch, <strong>Operation Onymous</strong>, the operation involved the police forces of 17 countries, more than 400 sites were closed and 17 arrests were made.
							<br>
							<br> 
							<strong>Our goals: </strong>
							If the anonymity factor remains intact, tools have been developed to scrape and archive most services available on the TOR network. From forums to marketplaces, including search engines, messaging services, etc. This Project will try to get an overview of the impact of huge raids such as Operation Onymous on the darknet use.

			<h4>Market Analysis</h4>

			<div class="row" style=";margin-top:90px">
				<div class="span4 offset1">
					<h2><strong>Market Size</strong></h2>
					In order to study the impact of the operation onymous on the Agora Market, we firt was interested by the evolution of the number of products purchasable on the market. We can see here that, between the day just before <strong>onymous</strong> and the day after, there is an important gap in the number of products availables at that time. It seems that the operation had an impact on this feature but the market recover very quickly, less than a week after the operation.

					<h2><strong>Active vendors</strong></h2>
					We saw that the <strong> onymous </strong> operation resulted in a drop in the number of products. To understand why this number was decreasing, we analyzed the number of active suppliers on Agora (a supplier is considered "active" when he has certain products to sell on a given day). Indeed, the sellers who sold the retired products disappeared from the market after this event. More than 27% (311) of the active vendors stopped selling definitively that day, and the market never recover until july 2015 when it permanently closed.

			<div class="row" style=";margin-top:90px">
				<div class="span4 offset1">
					<h2><strong>New Vendors</strong></h2>
					While the <strong> Onymous </strong> operation has had a significant negative impact on the total number of suppliers in the Agora market, it has also closed other large markets, such as Silkroad, so we can ask ourselves if the closing of these markets entails moving users to Agora. We can see here that this is not the case, the number of new suppliers who publish a product each day is relatively stable, about 5 per day. A vendor is considered new the day when he publish is first product.

					<h2><strong>Vendors insights</strong></h2>
					Operation <strong>Onymous</strong> had an huge impact on the number of vendors on the Agora market, but how can we explain that the number of products listed on agora recovered so quickly. First of all, we notice here that the vendors that left after Onymous are, in majority, small suppliers (~8 products to sell) compare to those who stayed with ~20 listed products.  In addition, we find that the number of products listed by these large suppliers is growing faster than the rest of the suppliers after Onymous.
