							Since its first appearance in 2009, the term "Deep Web" has designated the non-indexed parts of the World Wide Web, that is by standard search engine. Using the development of a FOSS anonymity network software called TOR , a whole digital world was born and has been growing ever since. Making the best out of the anonymity that is provided to them, TOR users have, over the time, developed complex infrastructure in this Deep Web to make the discussion, the advertisement and the purchase of any service or item that would be deemed illegal by local authorities, accessible to all.

							<strong>Context: </strong>
							With this new kind of distribution, law enforcement had to adapt in order to regulate these illicit markets. On 5 and 6 November 2014 an international law enforcement operation targeting darknet markets and other hidden services operating on the Tor network was launch, <strong>Operation Onymous</strong>, the operation involved the police forces of 17 countries, more than 400 sites were closed and 17 arrests were made.
							<br>
							<br> 
							<strong>Our goals: </strong>
							If the anonymity factor remains intact, tools have been developed to scrape and archive most services available on the TOR network. From forums to marketplaces, including search engines, messaging services, etc. This Project will try to get an overview of the impact of huge raids such as Operation Onymous on the darknet use.

							The archive contains mostly scrapped html pages from the many marketplaces, forums and other services (e.g. Grams search engine) that were active during the period mentioned in the title. This raw data is organized first by service, then by date (meaning that for every service, one can go to a specific date and see a list of html pages). Every archive is unambiguous on the format of the platform it represents, standard formatting can then be expected (e.g. item, profile, forum thread, list of items, etc.). However it is expected to be highly incomplete and most likely present inconsistencies. All the directories are compressed using tar.gz compression. The whole archive is about 60 GiB compressed and estimated to be about 1TiB completely uncompressed.
