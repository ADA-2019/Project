# A Deep Analysis of the DeepWeb Evolution

# Abstract
Since its first appearance in 2009, the term "Deep Web" has designated the non-indexed parts of the _World Wide Web_, that is by standard search engine. Using the development of a _FOSS_ anonymity network software called _TOR_ , a whole digital world was born and has been growing ever since. Making the best out of the anonymity that is provided to them, _TOR_ users have, over the time, developed complex infrastructure in this _Deep Web_ to make the discussion, the advertisement and the purchase of any service or item that would be deemed illegal by local authorities, accessible to all.

However, if the anonymity factor remains intact, tools have however been developed to scrape and archive most services available on the _TOR_ network. From forums to marketplaces, including search engines, messaging services, etc. - the archive explored in the scope of this Project is as vast as the web is Deep. This Project will try to get an overview of its content and extract some meaning from it, understand what this data says about the people behind such services, and those using it.
